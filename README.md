The project focuses on developing and comparing two image classification models using Keras for identifying cracks in concrete surfaces. The dataset comprises concrete images, where the goal is to classify each image as cracked or not cracked.

The first model employs the VGG16 pre-trained model, known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The second model utilizes the RESNET50 architecture, recognized for its depth and feature extraction capabilities.

Both models are trained and fine-tuned using the concrete image dataset to accurately differentiate between cracked and non-cracked surfaces. Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess their performance.

Through comparing the VGG16 and RESNET50 models, the project aims to determine the more effective architecture for concrete crack detection. Insights gained from this analysis can guide future efforts in developing image classification systems for identifying cracks in concrete structures.
